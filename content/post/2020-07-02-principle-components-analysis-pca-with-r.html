<h1>Abstract</h1>
<p>PCA is a statistical technique used in many different settings. Often it is used in data analytics to reduce the
dimensions of a variable set. This is done through the linear combination of the raw variables to produce a
set of components the aim of which to capture the maximum amount of variance with the minimum number of components.</p>
